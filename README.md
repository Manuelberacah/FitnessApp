# Fitness & Diet App

## 🌟 My First Flutter Project!

This is my first Flutter project as I begin my journey into mobile app development. I created this fitness and diet app to learn the fundamentals of Flutter while building something useful that combines my interests in health and technology.

## 📱 About The Project

This fitness app provides users with diet recommendations, meal categories, and popular food options. It's designed with a clean, modern UI and includes interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
